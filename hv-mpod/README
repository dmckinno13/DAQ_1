To compile hvmon:

gcc -Wall -lcaenhvwrapper -lpthread -ldl -lm -o hvmon hvmon-v0.c

Currently, it uses snmp to contact MPOD IP addresses
and CAENHVWrapper calls to contact CAEN HV 1527 systems.
When other CAEN systems are needed, the .conf file and hvptr->
structure of the mapped memory should gain a caen system flag
for each channel.

Makefile can be used for any of the possibilities:
of using configurations:
u3/mmap  
u6/mmap
u3/shm
u6/shm

u3 or u6 means the labjack model being used.
mmap or shm means writing to DAQ_1/data or to a shared memory segment

make or make all produces all files necessary to run with labels signifying the 6 cases for main program and reader. 
these are named generally as programname-LabJackType-MemoryMode
or using generallly
make all-LabJackType-MemoryMode will produce 3 files:
lnfill
and 
lnfill-log
and
lnfill-read

example:
make 
compiles:
lnfill-u3-mmap lnfill-u6-mmap lnfill-log-mmap lnfill-read-mmap lnfill-u3-shm lnfill-u6-shm lnfill-log-shm lnfill-read-shm

make all-u3-mmap
compiles:
lnfill lnfill-log lnfill-read
