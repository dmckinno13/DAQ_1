LN fill flow chart and general mode operations...

Tank line:
 - 1 valve on tank (must be next to manifold overflow valve on iBootBar ... 8) 
 - 1 valve on manifold overflow (must be next to tank valve on iBootBar ... 7)
 - 1 overflow rtd on manifold
 - 1 pressure gauge (optional, should probably be downstream of valve
     unless vacuum jacketed line to manifold)

Detectors:
 - 1 valve at manifold
 - 1 detector rtd
 - 1 oveflow rtd

Philosophy of running
 - monitor detector temperatures by the minute for HV shutdown
 - during filling monitor detector overflows every 5 seconds
 - expect to "smooth" readings by taking an average of multiple readings
   to minimize false alarms due to noise
 - all detectors on a manifold will be kept to the same fill schedule
 - using a U6 we should be able to control 6 detectors plus the tank

Mode of operation on filling:
 - open manifold overflow and tank valves (manifold overflow was probably open)
 - can monitor pressure gauge to determine:
    - expected fill time (typically 3-5 minutes?)
    - empty dewar
    - other problems
 - when manifold rtd shows LN temps (likely to be below detector temps)
   close manifold overflow valve and open detector valves (typically
   takes 2-4 minutes depending on length)
 - when overflow rtd shows LN temps (likely to be below detector temps)
   close detector valve
 - when last detector valve closes, close tank valve
 - open manifold valve to release pressure in fill lines

Mode of operation on single detector filling:
 - repeat process above for group filling but only opening 1 detector valve
 - set next fill time to the detector with the next fill time 

Mode of operation on initial cool down:
 - repeat process above for group filling
 - set next fill time to 60 minutes
 - repeat process above for group filling
 - set next fill time to regular time
