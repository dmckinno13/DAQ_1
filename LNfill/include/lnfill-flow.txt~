LN fill flow chart and general mode operations...

Tank line:
 - 1 valve on tank
 - 1 valve on manifold overflow
 - 1 overflow rtd on manifold
 - 1 pressure gauge (optional, should probably be downstream of valve
     unless vacuum jacketed line to manifold)

Detectors:
 - 1 valve at manifold
 - 1 detector rtd
 - 1 oveflow rtd

Philosophy of running
 - monitor detector temperatures by the minute for HV shutdown
 - during filling monitor detector overflows every 5 seconds
 - expect to "smooth" readings by taking an average of multiple readings
   to minimize false alarms due to noise


Mode of operation on filling:
 - open manifold overflow and tank valves (manifold overflow was probably open)
 - can monitor pressure gauge to determine:
    - expected fill time (typically 3-5 minutes?)
    - empty dewar
    - other problems
 - when manifold rtd shows LN temps (likely to be below detector temps)
   close manifold overflow valve and open detector valves (typically
   takes 2-4 minutes depending on length)
 - when overflow rtd shows LN temps (likely to be below detector temps)
   close detector valve
 - when last detector valve closes, close tank valve
 - open manifold valve to release pressure in fill lines
